# D&D Condition Helper

This extension provides easy lookups for D&D conditions.

## Features

- Hover over a condition in a markdown file and see info about the condition (prone, incapacitated, etc).
- Use shortcut dnd-condition-helper.quickPick to allow a fuzzy find to quickly find the condition and associated information. Choose "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts" from the command palette. Selecting the condition will launch the D&D Beyond page for that condition.
